Thanks for using LogicgooseUI! Logicgoose, the original framework, allowed Node.js apps to easy call into ILE programs (be it COBOL, RPG, etc) without having to use XMLSERVICE. It worked by simply constructing and deconstructing buffers.

LogicgooseUI builds on that, and makes it easy for developers to create APIs, but to continue utilising RPG to build modern APIs.
